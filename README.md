# IoT25-HW05: ESP32 BLE Client for Environmental Sensor Display

This project demonstrates how to create a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection between two ESP32 devices: one acting as a **BLE Server** sending environmental sensor data (temperature and humidity), and the other as a **BLE Client** receiving and displaying that data on an **OLED screen**.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Objectives

- Establish a BLE connection between ESP32 devices (client â†” server)
- Receive real-time sensor data via BLE (temperature & humidity)
- Display values on an OLED (SSD1306)
- Use BLE notify characteristics for efficient data transfer

---

## ðŸ§° Components Used

- 2Ã— ESP32 DevKit boards  
- OLED Display (SSD1306 128Ã—64, I2C)  
- Temperature & Humidity Sensor (on server side)  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard  
- Micro USB cables  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Project Structure

- **BLE Server (not shown in code)** sends temperature and humidity readings via BLE characteristics.
- **This Client Code**:
  - Scans for the BLE server with name `ESP32_BLE_Server`
  - Connects using known UUIDs for temperature and humidity characteristics
  - Receives data via BLE notifications
  - Displays the readings on an OLED screen using Adafruit SSD1306 library

---

## ðŸ“„ Code Summary (Client)

- Temperature Characteristic UUID:  
  `cba1d466-344c-4be3-ab3f-189f80dd7518` (Â°C)  
- Humidity Characteristic UUID:  
  `ca73b3ba-39f6-4ab3-91ae-186dc9577d99`  

Main logic:
- Uses `BLEAdvertisedDeviceCallbacks` to detect the server
- Uses `registerForNotify()` to subscribe to live updates
- Renders readings on OLED using `Adafruit_SSD1306`
